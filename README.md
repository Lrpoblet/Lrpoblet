## üë©‚Äçüíª‚ÄäAbout me

I studied Social Work and specialized in the area of disability. My interest in technology and curiosity led me to an exciting transition to the world of web development.

Recently, I have had the opportunity to work as a Frontend Developer at Kair√≥s DS, where I have created reusable JavaScript components with LitElement and improved the accessibility and performance of their commercial website. I have also applied tests with Jest and Cypress and worked on continuous integration and deployments with Docker, among other fundamental tasks. In addition to my experience with the aforementioned technologies, I have also worked on several projects using React as my main framework and SASS for styles.
